## About me
Dattaraj is a highly accomplished technology leader mentoring global team of 200+ data scientists and a published author, with 11 granted patents in artificial intelligence. He brings 25 years experience in Product and Services industry, delivering innovation in Computer Vision, Natural Language Understanding, Generative AI, Knowledge Graphs and Federated Learning.

Dattaraj is leading a team of world-class data scientists, championing strategic initiatives like the GenAI Hub and Responsible AI framework. GenAI Hub is helping Customers adopt a multi-vendor large language models (LLM) strategy, get complete cost observability, build advanced agents and achieve 50% faster GTM velocity. His team is delivering accelerators like Credit Recommendation, Intelligent Claims Agent, Content Generator and Cyber Threat Intelligence. These leverage advance LLM technology like prompt optimization (DSPy), fine-tuning (LoRA, MLX) and agentic workflows (Crew.ai, Autogen), to real-world business problems in BFSI and Healthcare.

Earlier, Dattaraj worked for 20 years at General Electric delivering innovation in remote monitoring & diagnostics (RM&D) and video analytics. He incubated “LocoVISION” from an idea into a successful $200MM product offering, for railway track inspection using onboard cameras. He streamlined the architecture for GE Power’s RM&D centre in Atlanta, that monitors more than 5000 gas and wind turbines globally. His book “Keras to Kubernetes” is widely acknowledged to bring together domains of data science and software deployment.

## Experience
**Chief Data Scientist - Persistent (2019-Present)** <br/>
- Delivered GenAI Hub accelerator that is adopted by key Customers in Retail, FinTech, Insurance, Healthcare to deliver cross-LLM Generative AI experiences at scale, with complete observability, following principles of Responsible AI.

- Built an Agentic workflow for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) that presents a hyper-personalized view of CTI feeds (STIX, RSS, Emails) mapped to network assets of an Enterprise. Leveraging LLM powered agents, the system enables a risk management dashboard enabled via role-playing and multi-agent collaboration.

- Delivered an insurance agent application that uses large multi- modal models (LMM) to perform a holistic analysis of claims in real-time saving more than 50% on manual processing time.

- Developed a knowledge graph (KG) solution for Pharma company to extract knowledge from raw documents, map to ontology and populate a KG, and use the KG for advanced analysis like domain search for drug discovery and drug-drug interactions.

**Principal Architect - GE Transportation (2013-2019)** <br/>
- Incubated LocoVision product from an idea to an Industrial Internet solution with state-of-the-art video processing and Computer Vision algorithms. Evangelized the solution via Customer workshops and conferences (NVIDIA, Indian Railways).

- Architected Kubernetes-based Platform to deliver a standardized path-to-production for Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Empowered Data Scientists with AI workbenches (H2O.ai, Jupyter), MLOps pipelines (Kubeflow, MLFlow) and distributed GPU runtimes.

- Innovation Leader for a 500+ strong India Engineering organization, mentoring teams to ideate, connect to product roadmap and file for patents.
  
**Chief Software Architect - GE Power (2004-2013)** <br/>
- Developed the Technology road-map for GE Power's Remote Monitoring & Diagnostics (RM&D) center at Atlanta that monitors more than 2000 Gas Turbines 24/7 across the world. 

- Championed the simplification of overall System Architecture for Edge to Back-office data transfer, scalable Analytics and Business Intelligence. Incubated major initiatives like Common Rules Engine program - that integrates individual AI engines like Fuzzy Inference and Neural Networks into a unified environment with shared Asset model, Orchestration and Dashboards. 

- Actively represented RM&D in synergy efforts with other Power businesses like Oil & Gas and Electric Utilities. Adopted best practices like Common Information Model (CIM) from Utilities domain and applied to Power-Gen by adopting standards like OpenO&M.
  
**Research Engineer - GE Global Research (2000-2004)** <br/>
- Developed a Knowledge-based Engineering (KBE) solution for Transportation CAD systems. Leveraged System-level thinking to co-relate high level requirements and flow them down to individual component geometry changes. 

- Developed solutions using Unigraphics and Knowledge Fusion to capture Design Knowledge into the system - through multiple interviews with Designers understanding their thought process. Achieved 30% reduction in model building time and improved overall Design Quality.
